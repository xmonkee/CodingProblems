In Flipboard's article[1], they kindly divulge their interpretation
of the summarization technique called LexRank[2].

While reading Flipboard's article, you can, if followed point by point, 
reimplement their summarization algorithm.
Here are the steps/excerpts that stood out to me:

    1. We model sentences as bags of words

    2. The strength of interaction... [can be measured by] standard
       metrics for this, such as Jaccard similarity...

    Note: We skip the normalization step
    3. The normalized adjacency matrix[3] of the graph is...

    4. We can compute the PageRank centrality measure for each sentence
       in the document.

I dont know what the technical name is for that double for-loop.

                It will most likely be my basement, or a little corner of my \
                basement. But I didn\'t write Star Wars. If I had, I might be \
                able to build a museum on the sparkling lakefront of Chicago, \
                right next to Soldier Field. George Lucas did write Star Wars, \
                and his art and memorabilia collections will be housed in his \
                Museum of Narrative Art in the Windy City. Lucas just \
                announced that Beijing-based MAD Architects will design the \
                museum, while Chicago firm Studio Gang Architects will be \
                responsible for the surrounding landscape and a pedestrian \
                bridge that links nearby peninsula Northerly Island with the \
                city. It should be a stunning addition to the collection of \
                shoreline museums, but it has encountered opposition from \
                open-space advocates and Bears fans, as the museum will \
                occupy part of their tailgating field. In honor of the \
                Museum of Narrative Art and its star-studded cast of \
                architects, here\'s a roundup of articles from Architizer \
                that feature Star Wars-related architecture: Jeff Bennett\'s \
                Wars on Kinkade are hilarious paintings that ravage the \
                peaceful landscapes of Thomas Kinkade with the brutal \
                destruction of Star Wars. It is not unlike a contemporary \
                rendering, which combines Sci-fi and Romantic notions, and \
                we have examples with ratings. Ra di Martino, a visual artist \
                and filmmaker, found the ruins of Star Wars sets, and \
                photographed them in her two series, No More Stars (Star Wars) \
                and EVERY WORLD\'S A STAGE. These haunting images show a world \
                far, far away, now left as ghost towns. These haunting images \
                show a world far, far away, now left as ghost towns. We \
                explore the designs and the blueprints behind the architecture \
                of the Rebel Alliance and the Empire. Artist \u00E9 Delsaux \
                photoshops Star Wars characters and ships into everyday \
                environments. Stormtroopers roam parking lots, the Millennium \
                Falcon visits a Dubai construction site, and the Emperor lurks \
                in the suburbs. Aedas appropriates the Sandcrawler for an office \
                building, but replaces the weathered, rough brown material \
                (COR-TEN?) with shiny glass and the treads with landscaping. \
